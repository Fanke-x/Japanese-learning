# Mapping repo materials to JLPT N1 sections

Note: JLPT N1 tests passive/recognition skills (文字・語彙, 文法, 読解, 聴解). There is no production (writing/speaking) section on JLPT.

## 文字・語彙 (Vocabulary & Kanji)
- Use: `vocab/*_annotated.csv` and `tools/vocab_reading_*.tsv` (reading→kanji drills). Focus on reading recall and kanji recognition.
- Daily target: 40 items (mix of new + review)

## 文法 (Grammar)
- Use: `grammar/grammar_100.csv`, `grammar/exercises_01.md`, `grammar/grammar_more.md`.
- Focus: pattern meaning, 接続, nuance differences, and sentence parsing for 読解.

## 読解 (Reading)
- Use: `reading/*` files. Time yourself and practice gist/detail questions.
- Strategy: train skimming for structure, scanning for detail, and paraphrase inference steps.

## 聴解 (Listening)
- Use: `listening/*`. Shadow, dictation, and speed scaling drills help.
- Target: 30–40 min/day in the peak weeks.

## Writing / Speaking (Not on JLPT)
- `writing/writing_prompts.md` is optional. Keep for active production practice (helpful for interviews, essays). Reduce priority during final weeks; keep to maintain expressive ability.

## How to prioritize
1. Vocabulary & Kanji (reading first)
2. Reading speed (time drills)
3. Listening accuracy under speed
4. Grammar nuance (applied in reading)
5. Production exercises (optional; keep lightweight)
