# Kanji Reading Drills

Practice formats:

1) Reading→Kanji quick recall (30 words, 15 min) — use TSV decks in `tools/`.
2) Kanji decomposition: pick 10 complex kanji, write readings (on/kun), list compounds.
3) Minimal pairs: pick pairs like 橋/箸/端; drill at 0.8x, 1x, 1.2x speeds to lock pitch.
4) Self-test: write meanings in Chinese and then write correct reading in kana.

Daily micro-routine (10–15 min):
- 5 min: flash recall of 20 flagged kanji
- 5 min: pitch drill for hardest 5
- 5 min: decomposition + compound generation
