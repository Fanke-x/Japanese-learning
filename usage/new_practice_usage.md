# How to Use the New Practice Suite — Quick Start

1) Daily flow (90–150 min total):
   - Morning (30–45): Vocab SRS + Kanji reading drills
   - Midday (30–45): Grammar production + Timed reading
   - Evening (30–45): Listening shadow + Writing prompt (every 3 days)

2) Weekly mocks: replace one reading session with a full mock. Analyze mistakes and add them to the error log.

3) Tools mapping:
   - `tools/quiz.py` — vocab/grammar drill
   - `tools/export_to_tsv.py` — create reading→kanji TSV
   - `tools/batch_prepare.py` — regenerate annotated/TSV decks if you modify CSVs

4) Rapid triage:
   - If listening is failing consistently, increase shadowing to 30 min/day for a week and reduce new vocab intake.
   - If reading speed lags, practice 10-min timed articles and push for reduction by 1 min each session.

5) Logging:
   - Use `planning/four_week_tracker.md` error log table to capture: date, item, source, mistake, fix strategy, status.

6) When to rest:
   - If you miss more than 2 consecutive daily goal boxes, take a half rest day then resume.
